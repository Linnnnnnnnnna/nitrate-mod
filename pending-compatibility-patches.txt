PENDING COMPATIBILITY PATCHES
=============================

The following is a list of TODO patches Nitrate needs to make to mod assemblies
to main BINARY COMPATIBILITY (WE DON'T CARE ABOUT SOURCE COMPATIBILITY).

class ReLogic.Content.Readers.PngReader
{
    // Removed by Nitrate.
    Type[] GetAssociatedTypes() => [typeof(Texture2D)];
}

ReLogic.Content.Readers.XnbReader
{
    // Made private by Nitrate, redirect LoadOnMainThread<T>.Value accesses to
    // preferred Nitrate API (XnbReader.(Get|Set)LoadOnMainThread<T>())
    static class LoadOnMainThread<T>
    {
        // Converted from field to property.
        bool Value { get; set; }
    }
}
